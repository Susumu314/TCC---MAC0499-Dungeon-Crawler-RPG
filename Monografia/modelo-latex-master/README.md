# IME/USP LaTeX Template

A LaTeX template for Masters and PhD/Doctorate dissertations/theses
according to IME/USP guidelines. Note that the actual formatting of
the document (fonts, cover layout, spacing etc.) is *not* mandatory;
the guidelines deal with the document structure only (the [description
of the guidelines](https://www.ime.usp.br/dcc/pos/normas/tesesedissertacoes)
is included in the template). The template is expected to be useful
for unexperienced LaTeX users. Feel free to customize to your needs
and, if appropriate, send us improvements. :)

The [generated PDF file](https://gitlab.com/ccsl-usp/modelo-latex/raw/master/pre-compilados/tese-exemplo.pdf?inline=false)
includes a FAQ, a short (but reasonably
compreehensive) LaTeX tutorial, and some examples of LaTeX commands.
There is also a simple and short [cheat sheet](https://gitlab.com/ccsl-usp/modelo-latex/raw/master/pre-compilados/colinha.pdf?inline=false)
(in Portuguese).

Besides that, there are lots of comments in the "tese.tex"
and other included .tex files about the packages used and things
you might want to customize or learn more about. These comments are
in Brazilian Portuguese. Even if you have some LaTeX experience, you
may benefit from skimming the comments, tutorial, and examples, as
they include some useful tips.

You need a reasonably recent working LaTeX installation (TeXLive 2016
works, but we recommend 2018 or newer), including biber and biblatex
(among other packages). The document may be compiled with "make" or
"latexmk" (preferred) and this repo includes a compiled version of it.

## FAQ

There is a FAQ in the example document and this repo includes a
[compiled version of it in PDF format](https://gitlab.com/ccsl-usp/modelo-latex/raw/master/pre-compilados/tese-exemplo.pdf?inline=false).

## Used packages and installation

There are some instalation instructions in the [example document,
included in this repo in PDF format](https://gitlab.com/ccsl-usp/modelo-latex/raw/master/pre-compilados/tese-exemplo.pdf?inline=false).
The template uses makeindex, biber, and many LaTeX packages.

These packages are directly used in the template: etoolbox, xstring, xparse,
calc, geometry, ifxetex, ifluatex, ifpdf, fontenc, inputenc, amsthm, babel,
microtype, indentfirst, footmisc, emptypage, caption, hyperref, biblatex,
setspace, parskip, xcolor, ragged2e, textcase, fontaxes, fancyhdr, graphicx,
float, flafter, placeins, pdflscape, rotating, subcaption, wrapfig, pdfpages,
tablefootnote, array, dcolumn, longtable, multirow, makecell, booktabs,
tocbibind, imakeidx, verbatim, latexsym, amsmath, amssymb, mathtools,
csquotes, hypcap, hyperxmp, url, listings, textcomp, multicol, metalogo,
epigraph, imakeidx, todonotes, soul, soulutf8, translator, pgfgantt, titletoc,
titlesec, titleps, framed. Many others are loaded indirectly by these.

The default fonts depend on these packages: lmodern, fix-cm,
libertine or libertinus, newtxmath, biolinum, souce code pro.

These packages are not used, but are mentioned and might be useful:
lastpage, braket, siunitx, varioref, cleveref, gensymb,
glossaries, backref, newtxtt, newtxtext, gentium, DejaVuSansMono,
tikz, pgfplots.

These packages may be useful if you intend to use xelatex/lualatex:
polyglossia, fontspec.

The example presentation and poster use beamer, beamerposter,
appendixnumberbeamer, beamertheme-metropolis.

As of 2018, in debian/ubuntu systems, you need to install (with their
dependencies) at least: texlive-base, texlive-latex-base,
texlive-fonts-recommended, texlive-generic-recommended,
texlive-latex-recommended, texlive-latex-extra, texlive-fonts-extra,
texlive-bibtex-extra, texlive-lang-portuguese, texlive-lang-english,
